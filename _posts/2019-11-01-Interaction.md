Directly modifying friction of the bare finger sliding on glass opens a whole new range of possible interactions that were not achievable with force-feedback or vibrotactile stimulation. We explore the design space of tactile stimuli that can be produced with friction modulation to enable the production of virtual relief, texture and buttons on touchscreens.
