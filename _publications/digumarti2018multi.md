## Abstract
This paper presents the design of a planar, low profile, multi-directional soft crawling robot. The robot combines soft electroactive polymer actuators with compliant electroadhesive feet. A theoretical model of a multi-sector dielectric elastomer actuator is presented. The relation between actuator stroke and blocking force is experimentally validated. Electrostatic adhesion is employed to provide traction between the feet of the robot and the crawling surface. Shear force is experimentally determined and forces up to 3N have been achieved with the current pad design. A 2D multi-directional gait is demonstrated with the robot prototype. Speeds up to 12mm/s (0.1 body-lengths/s) have been observed. The robot has the potential to move on a variety of surfaces and across gradients, a useful ability in scenarios involving exploration.
