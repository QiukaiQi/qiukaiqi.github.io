### Research

Michael Wiertlewski is interested in understanding how humans and robots use their sense of touch to perceive and manipulate their environment. In particular, he studies in the mechanic that underpins the perception of frictional properties and interaction. Over the years, he has developed and built a variety of haptic interfaces, robotic tactile sensors and experimental setup to investigate the role of friction in touch.  
He now leads the Surface Haptics lab at TU Delft.

### Bio

He has been trained to the art of signal processing, psychophysics and haptics at the ISIR lab of Sorbonne University (Paris 6). He later joined the Neuroscience and Robotics lab in Northwestern University to work on ultrasonic friction modulation. From 2015 to 2019, he was CNRS researcher and group leader in haptics at the Aix-Marseille Université, and since 2019, he is assistant professor at the Cognitive Robotics Department of the TU Delft.
