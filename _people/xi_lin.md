### Research

Xi Lin's research interests focuses on robotic tactile sensors and bio-inspired control of grasp. She developed a camera based soft tactile sensor using the color mixing principle to estimate the frictional information, 3d forces and deformations due to the contact between the sensor and the object.


### Bio

Xi Lin obtained her BSc degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2014 and her MSc degree in Robotics and Advanced Systems in 2016, both from the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, France. Since 2017, She is PhD student in Aix-Marseille University in the Biorobotics group, and she is currently studying at the Cognitive Robotics Department of the TU Delft as a visiting PhD student.
