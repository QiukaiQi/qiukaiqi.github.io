### Research

Laurence Willemet is interested in haptics scene decoding. She tries to understand with modelling and psychophysics all the mechanical signals transmitted to the brain during tactile exploration. She has now a particular interest in friction perception on initial contact necessary to adjust the grip force during object manipulation.

### Bio

After an engineer background in microelectronics and computer science, she decided to follow one-year specialization in all the technologies linked to the health sector in Strasbourg. She did her master internship in Politecnico in Milan in man-robot interaction during assisted surgery. Then she joined the Institute of Movement Sciences in haptics field for her PhD. She is currently in her third year.
