### Research

Nicolas Huloux is interested in understanding how human interact with their surrounding environement through the sense of touch. In particular, how friction helps human to discriminate material from each others. The comprehension of friction perception aim to design tactile illusion on surface haptic interfaces.  


### Bio

He is from an engineer background teached in a french engineer school: Grenoble-INP and have a design touch since he pass a semester with designers around a project to mix art and science. Science was always at the core of its motivation and his internships was naturally run in labs. His first touch with signal procesing and wave mechanics was in the institute of earth science (ISTerre) in the wave and structure entity. Then for its master degree internship, he enters into the fascinating world of haptics. He now is in third year of a Ph.D degree.
