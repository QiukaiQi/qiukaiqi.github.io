In this project with Dr. Andrew Conn funded by the ELizabeth Balckwell Institute, Bristol, we looked at designing a microfluidic manipulator. The aim was to use it in a diagnostic device to direct microscopic particles in the medium. We fabricated and tested a device using an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) shown in the image below.
