This is an extension work based on WrinTac previously proposed in [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8638951). We further modified WrinTac to suit for robotic finger application, and tested the possibility of WrinTac to perform active sensing and perception by morphological adaptation instead of by control variation. Here, the morphing behavior of WrinTac was powered by bending actuation which much more suitful to robotic fingers.

This work is now published in Robotics and Automation Letters, and was presented at International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft) 2020 and was selected as [Best Paper Finalist](http://www.robosoft2020.org/). Access the paper at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9044791)
