Inspired by the morphological influence of human fingertips on tactile sensing and perception as illustrated in below figure, we propoed the wrinkled tactile sensor with variable and adaptive morphology (WrinTac). The fundamental idea is the sensor, in order to get optimal performance, can adapt the morphology to specific task or environment. In collaboration with [Prof. Shinichi Hirai](http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/se/~hirai/hirai/index-e.html), we modelled the wrinkling behaviour and chracterized the morphing capability enabled by stretching actuation. We then tested WrinTac preliminarily in different tasks including normal force sensing, tangential force sensing and shape classification and found that WrinTac can behave differently when it is under different morphology.
