As part of my masters thesis at ETH Zurich in collaboration with Disney Research, I looked at improving the performance of the Starl*ETH* robot in locomotion tasks. The core idea is that by simultaneous tuning of mechanical design and locomotion controllers, the performance of the robot can be optimised for a given task. In this case, the task was to follow a certain gait pattern (eg. trotting, bounding). The results of the co-optimisation show that the admissible top speed for a given gait can be increased while using the same actuation units.

I presented this work at the conference on climbing and walking robots (CLAWAR 2014). The paper can be accessed at [the publisher's page](https://doi.org/10.1142/9789814623353_0037). The project can also be accessed on Disney Research's [database](https://www.disneyresearch.com/publication/concurrent-optimization-of-mechanical-design-and-locomotion-control-of-a-legged-robot/)
