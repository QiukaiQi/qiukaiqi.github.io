In this work with Melanie Simons, we explored auxetic properties of cylindrical structures. By changing the tiling on the surface, its geometry and orientation, variation in property was observed. This apporach is amenable to parameterisaiton and it is therefore easy to explore the design space. Such structures can generate giant and controllable deformations without relying on large strains. They may be used in the construction of soft robots, smart structures for medical interventions and wearable devices.

We presented this work at the IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics 2019. Access the manuscript at [UoB's PURE](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/185062368/Tiled_Auxetic_Cylinders_For_Soft_Robots_Accepted_Preprint.pdf).
