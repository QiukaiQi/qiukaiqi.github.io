As an intern at Disney Research, Zurich with Prof. Stelian Coros, I worked on the design of a quadruped named Rojer. The goal of the design was to let the robot display personalities (eg. friendly, aggressive, shy) through the movement of the body. I designed the hardware for the robot and tuned its gait to show specific behaviours. It was a fun learning experience working with artists and animators from Disney and Pixar.
