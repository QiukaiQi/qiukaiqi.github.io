We proposed a novel mechanism for low-cost soft bending actuators. The mechanism consists of an internal balloon and an external plastic constrain layer, as shown in below figure. When pressurized, the actuator can generate bending deformation that can be used for driving. We verified the performance of actuators with different geometrical parameters and finally demonstrated the potential in application such as soft grippers.
