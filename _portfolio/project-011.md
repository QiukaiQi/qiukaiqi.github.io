EuMoBot, is a multi-segment soft robot inspired by the *Euglena* family of micro-organisms, that replicates large body deformations to achieve locomotion. Two robots were fabricated at different sizes operating with a constant internal volume, which exploit hyperelasticity of fluid-filled elastomeric chambers to replicate the motion of euglenoids. I showed that the movemet of the robots is hydrodynamically similar to that of the organism. This bio-mimetic robot can therefore both replicate biological motion and act as a tool for studying it.
