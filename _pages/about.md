I am a Research Associate at the [SoftLab, Bristol Robotics Laboratory](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/soft-robotics) in University of Bristol, and I work with [Prof. Jonathan Rossiter](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Jonathan-Rossiter-9fcc55a3-fc9a-43a3-97a5-3aceca87cf4f/). Prior to this position, I was a JSPS PD postdoc researcher at the [Suzumori-Endo Laboratory](http://www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/home.html) in Tokyo Institute of Technology, working with [Prof. Koichi Suzumori](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=tSmkV74AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering. I take inspirations from **Biology** and develop **Soft Robots** augmented with **life-like intelligence and functionality** such as **efficient actuation**, **active sensing**, **purposive morphing** and **autonomous grasping** by exploring smart materials (e.g., **functional polymers and composites**), structures (e.g., **multi-stable**) and mechanisms. I am also interested in **machine learning** technics and its application in soft robotics. Check out some of my [Projects](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/portfolio/) and go through my [Publications](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/publications/) for a glimpse of my research.
