I am a research associate at the [SoftLab](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/research/softlab/), part of the [Bristol Robotics Lab](http://brl.ac.uk). I work with [Prof. Jonathan Rossiter](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/person/jonathan-m-rossiter/overview.html).

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering. Its underlying theme has been to discern biological design through the modelling of natural systems and adapt it to robotic applications. 

A copy of my doctoral thesis can be accessed [here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/206707844/Final_Copy_2019_06_25_Digumarti_PhD_Redacted.pdf). It was supervised by Jonathan Rossiter and [Andrew Conn](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/people/andrew-t-conn/index.html).

Check out some of my projects and go through my publications for a sample of my research.
