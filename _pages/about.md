I am a PhD student at the [Soft Haptics Laboratory](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/ms/labs/vanho/index-e.html), and I work with [Prof. Van Anh Ho](https://fp.jaist.ac.jp/public/Default2.aspx?id=669&l=1). Currently, I undertake two research grants, one by the programme of [Grants-in-Aid](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/index.html) from JSPS (1,700,000 JPY) and the other by the programme of Houga Research Grant from JAIST (900,000 JPY), serving as **PI** (Principle Investigator). Look at my [CV](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/cv/) for more details.

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering. I take inspirations from *Biology* and develop *Soft Robots* augmented with life-like intelligence and functionality such as active sensing, purposive morphing and autonomous grasping by exploring smart materials, structures and mechanisms. Check out some of my [Projects](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/portfolio/) and go through my [Publications](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/publications/) for a glimpse of my research.

I have supervised two master interns with different topics, one on deep learning and the other on firmware development using C language. Refer to my [CV](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/cv/) for details.

**News**

*2020-12-30:* I finished a three-day hands-on training on nano fabrication in JAIST clean room with higher standards of cleanness than NASA, fabricating a nano scale gas sensor by suspending graphene. Many thanks to Dr. Liu for the very detailed instructions on spinning coating, baking, electron beam lithography (EBL), processing, and electron beam deposition.

*2020-12-25:* I have successfully defensed my PhD dissertation. Ready to go to next stage of life!
