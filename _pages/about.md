I am a PhD student at the [Soft Haptics Laboratory](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/ms/labs/vanho/index-e.html), and I work with [Prof. Van Anh Ho](https://fp.jaist.ac.jp/public/Default2.aspx?id=669&l=1). Currently, I undertake two grants, one from JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) and the other from JAIST (Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), serving as **PI** (Principle Investigator).

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering. I take inspirations from *biology* and develop *Soft Robots* augmented with life-like intelligence and functionality such as active sensing, purposive morphing and autonomous grasping by exploring novel mechanisms, smart materials and structures. Check out some of my projects and go through my publications for a glimpse of my research.
