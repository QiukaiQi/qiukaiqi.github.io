I am a JSPS PD postdoc researcher at the [Suzumori-Endo Laboratory](www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/home.html), and I work with [Prof. Koichi Suzumori](https://fp.jaist.ac.jp/public/Default2.aspx?id=669&l=1). Currently, I undertake one research grant by [Grants-in-Aid](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/index.html) from JSPS (1,700,000 JPY), serving as the **PI** (Principle Investigator). Look at my [CV](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/cv/) for more details.

My research sits at the interface between biology and engineering. I take inspirations from *Biology* and develop *Soft Robots* augmented with life-like intelligence and functionality such as active sensing, purposive morphing and autonomous grasping by exploring smart materials, structures and mechanisms. Check out some of my [Projects](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/portfolio/) and go through my [Publications](https://qiukaiqi.github.io/publications/) for a glimpse of my research.

**News**

**2021-Apl-01** I am officially joining Suzumori-Endo Lab in Tokyo Institute of Technology as a **JSPS PD** postdoc researcher working on Soft Robotics.

**2021-Mar-24** I received my PhD degree in information science, and successfully graduate from Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology with the **Outstanding Performance Award**.

**2021-Mar-01** We have a paper titled as "BPActuators: Lightweight and low-cost soft actuators by balloons and plastics" accepted by IEEE RoboSoft 2021.

**2021-Feb-10** I finished a full-day training on scanning electron microscope (SEM) (S-4500, Hitachi) in JAIST Center for Nano Materials and Technology. Many thanks to Mr. Notoya for the very detailed instructions.

**2021-Jan-30** I finished a three-day hands-on training on nano fabrication in JAIST clean room with higher standard of cleanness than NASA, fabricating a nano scale gas sensor by suspending graphene. Many thanks to Dr. Liu for the very detailed instructions on **spinning coating, baking, electron beam lithography, processing, and electron beam deposition**.

**2021-Jan-25** I have successfully defensed my PhD dissertation. Ready to go to next stage of life!
