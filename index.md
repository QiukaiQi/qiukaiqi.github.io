I am a PhD student in the [LHCb Collaboration](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) at CERN, based in the University of Bristol. The LHCb Experiment is a highly specialised particle detector, using data collected from proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](https://home.cern/) to answer fundamental physics questions such as why there is more matter than anti-matter in the Universe. 

My thesis focuses on the measurement of the decay $B^0 \rightarrow D^0 \overline{D}{}^0 K^+ \pi^-$, and I am the lead proponent of the first observation of this mode. Studying this decay has major implications for decays such as $B^0 \rightarrow K^{\ast0}\mu^+\mu^-$, which have shown tensions with the Standard Model of particle physics. Studying the structures in $B^0 \rightarrow D^0 \overline{D}{}^0 K^+ \pi^-$ will shed light on the theoretical uncertainties involved, and dictate the models that may be used to describe potential 'New Physics' processes. 

This blue signal region in the figure below demonstrates the observation of events corresponding to $B^0 \rightarrow D^0 \overline{D}{}^0 K^+ \pi^-$
